% Performs feature reduction using principal component analysis
%
% Inputs
%    feature_train: input matrix of training features
%                   (rows: examplars, columns: features)
%    Nfeat_out: number of features to reduce to (default inf; i.e. keep as
%               many features as possible)
%    feature_test: input matrix of testing features
%                  (rows: examplars, columns: features)
%                  These will be projected using the projection matrix
%                  determined from the feature_train.
%                  (default: empty)
%
% Outputs
%    feature_train_pca: output matrix of training features
%    feature_test_pca: output matrix of testing features
